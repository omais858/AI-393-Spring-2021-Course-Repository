## Abstract
In this Final Project we use following techniques.


### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a list of classification algorithms based on Bayes Theorem that is commonly used in Machine Learning. It's not only one algorithm, but a whole family of them, all based on the idea that each feature being categorised is unrelated to the meaning of any other feature.Since it is a simple concept, Naive Bayes can often outperform more complex algorithms and is extremely useful in applications such as spam detection and document classification.

### Linear Regression
The supervised learning algorithm Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm. A regression task is performed by it. Based on the independent variables, regression models a target prediction value. It is primarily used to determine the relationship between variables and to forecast.


### SVM
SVMs are supervised machine learning algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression. They are, however, most commonly used in classification issues. In comparison to other machine learning algorithms, SVMs have a unique way of implementation. Because of their ability to handle multiple continuous and categorical variables, they have become extremely popular in recent years.

### Convulation
The most common type of artificial neutral network is convolution, which is used to process pixel data in image recognition and processing. The layer of 2D convolution employs convolution. The term "conv2D" is commonly used to refer to it. It has a tiny kernel that slides along those two dimensions, essentially a window of pixel values. The RGB channel is obtained from beginning to end, first channel to last channel, rather than as a small depth window. We used it to create clearer images so that we could clearly recognise the digits..
