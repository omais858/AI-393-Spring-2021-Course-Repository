## Abstract
In this Final Project we use following techniques.


### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a list of classification algorithms based on Bayes Theorem that is commonly used in Machine Learning. It's not only one algorithm, but a whole family of them, all based on the idea that each feature being categorised is unrelated to the meaning of any other feature.Since it is a simple concept, Naive Bayes can often outperform more complex algorithms and is extremely useful in applications such as spam detection and document classification.

### Linear Regression
The supervised learning algorithm Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm. A regression task is performed by it. Based on the independent variables, regression models a target prediction value. It is primarily used to determine the relationship between variables and to forecast.


### SVM

### Convulation
